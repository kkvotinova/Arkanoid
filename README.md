## [Example](https://kkvotinova.github.io/Arkanoid/)
The player controls a small platform that can be moved horizontally from one wall to another, substituting it under the ball, preventing it from falling down. The impact of the ball on the brick leads to the destruction of the brick. After all the bricks are destroyed, the game ends.
